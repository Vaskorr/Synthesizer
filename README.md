# Synthesizer
Keyboard synthesizer project using JNativeHook &amp; MIDI sounds.


This project allows you to make a synthesizer out of the keyboard
that plays regardless of whether there is focus on the application, 
thanks to JNativeHook. It is possible to add your own sets of notes 
and play them by pressing the keys.
